== Introduction

Demo webapp for easy-jpa-entities.

== Usage (development setup)

Make sure that you have Java and Maven installed and available on your `PATH`.

  mvn verify

You can now start the backend

  cd backend
  ./run.sh

You can use the backend directly by querying
http://localhost:8080/api/persons
http://localhost:8080/api/addresses


Then, start the frontend

  cd frontend
  . ./setnodeenv.sh
  npm run start

A message _Web Dev Server started..._ appears and indicates what to do next.

This application may actually contain some functionality.
It is a work in progress...
